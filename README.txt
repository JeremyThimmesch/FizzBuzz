In this repository I will explore the basic Git commands.

I will create, commit and push multiple versions of FizzBuzz in various languages. 

FizzBuzz is a simple program that does the following:

# Print the numbers 1 - 100.
# Print Fizz if divisble by 3.
# Print Buzz if divisble by 5.
# Print FizzBuzz if divisble by both.
